This is a small python program that can be used alone or in combination with the main Harvester to help populate the providers.tsv file.
It pulls a snapshot of the entire [COUNTER Registry](https://registry.countermetrics.org/) data for 5.1 providers into a tab-delimited file.

I've also provided a recent run of it, as of May 3, 2025.

Be aware that this information is constantly changing, especially now when many providers are scrambling to get their 5.1 SUSHI servers working and passing the audits.
But at the least, it provides the info regarding their Base URL and some advice as to where you should look to get your institution's specific credentials (eg customer_id).
