Note that **Elsevier** enforces the 36-month limitation on start-end date range. So you will need to do multiple harvests to get all of the available data for each platform. Technically they are allowed do that, but most providers who are offering 5.1 data for more than 3 years back allow you to request it all at once.

**EBSCO** allows the longer range, but often times out when doing so for the TR and IR reports, so you may want to harvest those in smaller date ranges.
