Many providers have started to provider COUNTER 5.1 data before the required January 2025.

Here are some of them:
- Annual_Reviews: 2024-04
- AVMA: 2024-07  (American Veterinary Medical Association)
- EBSCO: 2022-01
- Edward_Elgar: 2024-07
- Elsevier Engineering Village: 2016-09  (use platform code: ev)
- Elsevier ScienceDirect: 2015-01   (use platform code: sd)
- Elsevier Scopus: 2021-04  (use platforms code: sc)
- Gale: 2022-01
- JSTOR: 2023-01
- Microbiology_Society: 2023-01
- Sage_books: 2023-01
- Wiley: 2024-08


Note that Elsevier enforces the 36-month limitation on start-end date range. So you will need to do multiple harvests to get all of the available data for each platform.

Technically they can do that, but most providers who are offering 5.1 data for more than 3 years back allow you to request it all at once.
