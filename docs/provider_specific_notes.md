#JSTOR

JSTOR requires you to run any particular report request twice, one full hour apart.
This program has no way to automate that large a time gap.
I recommend that you create a separate provider_jstor.tsv and put in your own calendar to re-run those later.
As described in another document, you can either edit the sushiconfig twice, to change the providers.tsv filename to the 
jstor one then put it back to your normal default, or copy your default providers.tsv to something like providers_all.tsv, 
then copy the jstor one into that, and then switch those back. Editing the sushiconfig is probably easier, but be careful not to break the formatting of that file.
