After you've set up the sushiconfig.py and providers.tsv to your needs, you simply run the program with this command line:
python3 json_to_sqlite.py     (depending on your operating system, you might leave off the "3")
It will ask you for begin and end dates for the data months you want to harvest.
It defaults to the first official date for COP5.1, which is January 2025, for the begin date, so just pressing Enter will give you that.
I defaults to the month before the current month you are running it in for the end date, so if you are running it in May 2025, the default end date will be April 2025 if
you just press Enter.

Then  it just runs until it's done. It puts some basic progress information in the running window, and will give special notice there for 
  problems that you probably want to know about, especially if a provider/report won't have the data you asked for.

The most common examples of that are if there is no data/usage for some or all of the date range you specified.

There is also an errorlog.txt file that is reset to empty after every run, that will have more data that may help you troubleshoot problems with individual providers.
It always start by giving you all of the URLs for all of the report types for all of the providers. You can actually paste a SUSHI API URL directly into your web browser to
see if it works, if there was a problem with it, and you can share that with the the providers tech support or anyone else you have helping you; just be aware that it contains all of
your "credentials" and some people consider parts of that to be like "passwords" so think carefully about where you share it.
