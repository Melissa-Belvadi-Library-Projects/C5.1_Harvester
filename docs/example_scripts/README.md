This folder includes example SQL scripts for the sqlite database that this project stores data in.

This will be a work in progress, and requests for scripts to do specific tasks should be sent to Melissa. 

The LLM GenAI systems, especially ChatGPT4 and Claude 3.7, are VERY good at writing complex sqlite queries, but you have to know enough to be very specific about what you want. They give you better answers if you tell them your actual table name, column names, relevant filter values on those columns, etc. so you don't have to replace "your_table" etc. in the proferred script.

If you want to write scripts in an editor like MS Word, be careful not to let it use "smart quotes" because that will break your sql code. Smart quotes are when the open and closing quotation marks are curled inward instead of being identical characters.
